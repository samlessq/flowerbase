Flower,the characteristics reproductive structure of angiosperms.As popularly used,the term "flower" especially applies when part or all the reproductive structure is distintive in colour and form.
in their range of colour, size, form, and anatomical arrangement, flowers present a<br> seemingly endless variety of combinations.Thet range in size from minute blossoms to<br> giant blooms.In some plants,such as poppy,magnolia, tulip and petunia,each flower is<br> relatively large and showy and is produced singly,while in other plants,such as aster,<br>snapdragon, and lilar,the individual flowers may be very small and are borne in a<br>distinctive cluster known as an inflorescence.Regardless of their variety,all flowers have<br> a uniform function,the reproduction of the species through the production of seed.
